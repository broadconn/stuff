// The movement style this class enacts goes like this:
// There are two movement request slots, one for the x axis, one for the y axis.
// These can each hold -1, 0, or 1. 
// 0 means no request, otherwise a direction on that axis has been requested. 
// The player can have both slots queued up. This allows the player to queue up a U-turn.
// The processor will enact both requests accordingly with respect to the current direction
// The processor will also ensure to not queue a direction request along the current axis, unless the other axis has already been requested.
